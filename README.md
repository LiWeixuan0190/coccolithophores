# coccolithophores
This is a repository storing all the codes using to plot figures for coccolithophores, including yearly mean data, 3DAILY variation and maps.
For the 3DAILY data, we use the shallowest data to plot.
In 3DAILY files, "TRAC##", ##=coccolithophores type +20. And for the number over 100, ##=0a(the letter is in the order of alphabet).
The 3DAILY files are in the director: /nobackup1/stephdut/GUD_20151027/run15_151_grazsame3_temperature_new_pared_nomort2/3DAILY

For the coexistence times of coccolithophores at each location and each time, please see the code in "3DAILY_final version.ipynb", the "Coexistence times of each location and each time" section.
