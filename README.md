# coccolithophores
This is a repository storing all the codes using to plot figures for coccolithophores, including yearly mean data, 3DAILY variation and maps.
For the 3DAILY data, we use the shallowest data to plot.
In 3DAILY files, "TRAC##", ##=coccolithophores type +20. And for the number over 100, ##=0a(the letter is in the order of alphabet).
